Each layer depends on the layer(s) below.

Tests may only depend on constants specified by the specification, not anything
implementation specific.

Changing anything in Specification implies changing the specification, so
that's normally not what you want to do.

Model: GameState, implementation constants (e.g. tile size, screen size), ...

Specification: constants, ... as specified and used by the specification.
